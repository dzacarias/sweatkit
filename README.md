# sweatkit

sweatkit is a Clojure(Script) library to work with sports activities data.

The main idea behind sweatkit is that this kind of data is a fundamentally composable thing. By this we mean that you should be able to get the same sort of information out of a few minutes of training, whole segments/laps, a single activity or collections of activities.
