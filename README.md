# sweatkit

sweatkit is a Clojure(Script) library to work with sports activities data.

**This is alpha software. The API and code structure are subject to change.**

*Comments and pull requests are more than welcome. Due to the project's
stage, please open an issue before submitting a PR so an approach can be
discussed prior to your work*

## Goals and Motivation ##

In a nutshell, sweatkit is a set of:

- Composable abstractions and functions to work with sports activity data
- Facilities to get data from/to different sports activities formats

The library is motivated by the need to get the same kind of information from this data, on different time-scales (e.g., from a few seconds of a run to a collection of runs). 

Also, since this area is prolific in proprietary data silos, we need to support parsing/emitting from/to the most common data formats.

## Usage

**Leiningen dependency info will be available here when there's an official release**

### Examples

Let's start by parsing a TCX file into sweatkit's format:

```clojure
(require '[sweatkit.formats.tcx :as tcx])
(require '[sweatkit.core :as s])
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

; Provide a TCX File/InputStream/String (Clojure) or String (ClojureScript)
(def p (tcx/parse (io/file "FitnessHistoryDetail.tcx")))

=> p
{:activities
  [{
    ; -> Starting instant
    :dtstart #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:41.000Z>,
    ; -> Any extra info
    :annotations {:notes nil},
    ; -> The activity's segments (usually called "laps")
    :segments
    [{:metrics
      {:altitude
       ; -> When there's a track of values for a metric, it appears like this:
       {:track 
        ({:altitude 3.982666,
          :instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:41.000Z>}
          ...
          )},
       :distance
       {:track
        ({:distance 0.0,
          :instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:41.000Z>}
         {:distance 6.3073034,
          :instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:48.000Z>}
         {:distance 7.5551758,
          :instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:54.000Z>}
          ...
          })},
       ; -> Some metrics may only have global values
       :speed {:max 18.6828499}, 
       :calories {:total 285}},
      :annotations {:notes nil},
      ; -> What caused this segment to be created (manually or some metric)
      :trigger :manual,
      ; -> It was an active (not resting) period
      :active true,
      ; -> How long it was, in milliseconds
      :duration 2325020,
      ; -> When it started
      :dtstart #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:41.000Z>,
      ; -> A segment may only refer to a single sport
      :sport :running}]}]}
```

A basic concept in sweatkit is the "measured" abstraction (through the IMeasured protocol). It represents something that has a set of sports metrics recorded over a time interval. Most of the public functions take "measured" objects. 

To start using sweatkit, you take a map like the one described above and feed it into the sweatkit.core/db function. It will return a mostly identical new map where each activity will implement the IMeasured protocol:

```clojure
; Build the parsed structure and get the first activity 
(def act (-> (s/db p) :activities first))

; The activity is a measured object that may be fed into other fns
(s/measured? act)
;; => true

; Get the available metrics
(:calories :speed :position :distance :altitude)


; Get the average altitude
(s/altitude act :avg)
;; => 8.129691

; Get the max speed
(s/speed act :max)
;; => 18.6828499
;; These are meters/second, by the way (sweatkit uses metric units everywhere).

; Trying to a get a metric value that doesn't exist
(s/speed act :min)
;; => nil
```

Sequential collections containing IMeasured or IPointValue objects are extended to implement IMeasured, which allows you to do stuff like this:

```clojure
; Getting a full metric track, getting Point Values
(s/altitude act)
;; => (#sweatkit.core.PointValue{:instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:41.000Z>, :value 3.982666, :metric :altitude} #sweatkit.core.PointValue{:instant #<DateTime 2007-08-07T02:42:48.000Z>, :value 4.4632568, :metric :altitude}
 ; ...
 )
 
; This is seq implementing IMeasured
(s/measured? (take 3 (s/altitude act)))
;; => true

; Get the average altitude for the activity's first 10 trackpoints (each an IPointValue)
(altitude (take 10 (altitude act)) :avg)

; Get the activity's splits every 1000 meters (returns a vector of IMeasured)
(def sp (s/splits act :distance 1000))

(count sp)
; => 9

; Since vectors implement IMeasured, you can query them using the standard fns:
(s/metrics sp)
; => (:altitude :position :distance)

; Notice that the set of metrics is not the same as the activity's. When splitting an IMeasured, you only get back the metrics with tracks, because already reduces values (like max or avg) can't be split.

; The split's global values are the same as the activity's:
(s/distance act :total)
;; => 8349.8964844

(s/distance sp :total)
;; => 8349.8964844

; Since every split implements IMeasured, you can query it like anything else
(s/altitude (first sp) :avg)
;; => 8.40672815097235

## Roadmap

sweatkit's development will be driven mostly by needs that arise while working on a related project (TBA soon). To give you an idea of where we're headed, here's a list of features that we'd like to add over time:

- TCX format emitting
- FIT format parsing/emitting
- Support for workout plans and courses
- Performance Analysis and Projections
- Distance & Altitude calculations from geo tracks
- More sports types (testing & possible adaptations)
